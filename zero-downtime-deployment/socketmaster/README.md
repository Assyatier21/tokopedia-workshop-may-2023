# Socketmaster

In this demo, we use Tokopedia's version of Socketmaster (https://github.com/tokopedia/socketmaster).

We already prepare the binary version in `/bin/socketmaster`, but in case you want to compile the binary by yourself, here is how:

1. clone the [repository](https://github.com/tokopedia/socketmaster)

2. open your terminal in repository root

3. run make command:

    ```
    make
    ```

4. done! you can check for binary file with the name of `socketmaster` in repository root

It is open for public, so feel free to use it for your work or projects.
